# Bon-Appetite
For a lab in my Human Computer Interaction class, we had to design and implement a website of our choice and I created Bon Appetite, where anyone who loves food can go to look at, experiment or try a recipe of their choosing.

These were the instructions:

Website Project

CISC 3650, Spring 2018, Assignment #1 Prof. Kletenik

The goal of this project is to create a website that collects user information for some purpose. That purpose is up to you. 

For example:

• A website to allows college students to upload information about themselves with the goal of creating an online collection of resumes

• A website that allows users to upload favorite recipes

• A website that collects voter information for political polls

• A website that collects information about applicants for auto insurance

• etc.

Your goal is to create a well-designed user interface using client-side programming. You do not need to store any information on the server – i.e., you may ask the user for their username and password, but you don’t need to store that information anywhere and will never need to retrieve it.

You are asked to use some client-side session storage. This is not something that you’d ever use for long-term storage, or for anything that you’d need to access on your own.

The emphasis of this project is on designing the interface in an intuitive and clear way that maximises the user experience. In Section 2, you are given a list of client-side programming functionalities that must be worked into your site. (Yes, you will need to be creative to work it all in!) 

Read through the section before beginning to design so that you know what you will need to incorporate. However the emphasis should be on the user design.
